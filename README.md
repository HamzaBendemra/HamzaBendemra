## 👋 Hello, I’m Hamza Bendemra

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m a **AI & ML Lead** with a passion for solving complex business problems through **AI, data, and intelligent systems**.

Based in Abu Dhabi 🇦🇪, I build end-to-end AI platforms that power data-driven decision-making. My expertise lies in **machine learning**, **LLMs**, and **cloud-native MLOps** — and in translating complex models into business value.

I believe the future belongs to systems that learn responsibly and empower humans.

🚀 From insight to impact — that’s the mission.
